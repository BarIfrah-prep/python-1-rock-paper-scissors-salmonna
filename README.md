This is the **README** file. a **README** file is a text, or as you can see here, an "MD" file,\
where all of your program information (how to run, what is the input/output, and everything you think is nessecary for the understanding of your code).\
I'll give you a template this time, but from here on you'll need to manage this by yourselves. Good luck!

# Rock Paper Scissors!
first I created a list that take the 'Rock Paper Scissors' and change that to numbers , for make it eazy to players .
after that created random choice that will play again player .
 
**CODE:**
I put while loop on all code . 
if the player want a rematch the loop will happen , if player don't want it will stop.
after that I created code that if player don't choose number 1,2,3 , the code will
ask him to choose number again .
in the end the code take the player choice and random choice to decide who win this game .
